Similarly if the due day changes to later in the month, we can advance the maturity date.\\n\\nBy using maturity date, we can keep this calculation centered around date math instead of working with payments and \\nminimum amounts (which should be left for the re-amortization process).\",\n",

If the borrower later on decides to cancel the Auto debit then the loan interest rate would need to be adjusted up that same amount and have a re-am take place.',\n",
